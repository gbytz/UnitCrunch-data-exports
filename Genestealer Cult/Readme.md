# Genestealer Cult Index v1.1
## General Information
* This Index contains all units from the current `Index: Genestealer Cult`
  
* **`Leaders`** are all separate unit profiles acting as if they were a sole unit on the battlefield, they include their **`Leader`** ability but this should be left inactive unless simulating that effect.
  
* All units that have the `Damaged: 1-X Wounds Remaining` ability have a `-1 to hit roll (if attacker)` ability in their unit profile that can be enabled.
  
* All unit profiles have the weapons shown on their datasheet unless specified.
