# Mixing Profiles
With the latest UnitCrunch update v0.64, we can now create an **Advanced Profile** allowing us to mix and match existing Profiles.

There are two sections within this document:
* **How to mix Profiles:** This will cover creating an **Advanced Profile** consisting of pre-existing Profiles. (This will mostly be used for Leader & Bodyguard combinations)
* **Formatting a Basic Profile:** This will guide you on how to edit a Basic Profile to be compatible with Advanced Profiles.

Existing Data Exports are going to be updated so that you will not need to format these profiles yourselves, but that process will take awhile and the **Formatting a Basic Profile:** guide will help anyone until then.

> [!NOTE]  
> These guides assumes you have already imported the Data Export you wish to use.
