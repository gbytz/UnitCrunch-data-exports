# Agents of the Imperium Index v1.1
## General Information
* This Index contains all units from the current `Index: Agents of the Imperium`.
  
* **`Leaders`** are all separate unit profiles acting as if they were a sole unit on the battlefield, they include their **`Leader`** ability but this should only be used in an **Advanced Profile**. (Refer to [Mixing_Profiles.md](/Guides/Mixing_Profiles.md))
  
* All unit profiles that have a squad size have been created at their **Maximum** size unless stated otherwise.
  
* All unit profile weapons have the default maximum `Count per unit` for that squad size.
  
* All unit profiles have the weapons shown on their datasheet unless specified.
