###### 25/07/2023
***NOTE: Some of the descriptions below could be inaccurate as this took a while to create and Unitcrunch has had updates since.***
### General
* All eligible unit profiles have 3 abilities representing the beneficial moments of the army rule **`For the Greater Good`** (**FTGG**) and the detachment rule **`Kauyon`**:
	* **`Improve BS by 1`** (Guided shooting spotted unit)
	* **`Critical hit: 1 extra hit`** (Kauyon)
	* **`Critical hit: 2 extra hits`** (Kauyon & Guided shooting spotted unit)
* I have not included the negative ability for guided units not shooting at there spotted unit in any of the unit profiles.
* Also the **`[IGNORES COVER]`** gained from being observed by a unit with **`Markerlights`** has not been added to any of the unit profiles.

* **`Leaders`** are all separate unit profiles acting as if they were a sole unit on the battlefield and thus they do not include there **`Leader`** ability.

* All unit profile weapons have the default maximum count per unit.

* Some Drone wargear is present on eligible Unit profiles:
	* Gun Drone - Maximum amount of gun drone weapons added to that unit.
	* Shield Drone - Not included, you will need to manually increase the Wounds of your unit.
	* Marker Drone - Not needed
	* Guardian Drone - As a unit ability.
	* Missile Drone - Maximum amount of missile drone weapons added to that unit.

All units that have **`Damaged: 1-X Wounds Remaining`** have a -1 to hit roll ability in there unit profile that can be turned on/off.

### Units
#### Current Range
* **Aun'va:** has several profiles due to different characteristics
* **Longstrike:** **`Targeting array`** has not been included, this will need to be added to one individual weapon profile manually.

* **Tidewall:** Excluded from unit profiles.
* **Stormsurge:** Have not included **`support System`** as i cannot make an ability for this.
* **Kroot Farstalkers:** Have not included **`Pech'ra`** wargear ability as this would need to added to each weapon individually.
#### Forgeworld Range
* **Y'vahra Battlesuit, R'varna Battlesuit:** Have not included **`Weapon support System`** for ignoring hit roll modifiers.
* **AX-1-0 Tiger Shark:** The **`Titan Hunter`** ability is already baked into the weapon profiles.
