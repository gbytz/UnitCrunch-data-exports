# Chaos Knights Index v1.0
## General Information
* This Index contains all units from the current `Index: Chaos Knights` and the `Imperial Armour: Chaos Knights`.
  
* All unit profile weapons have the default maximum `Count per unit` for that unit composition.
  
* Every Unit has the `Damaged: 1-X Wounds Remaining` ability, i'd suggest adding `-1 to hit roll (if attacker)` to the **Global Modifiers**.
  
* All unit profiles have the weapons shown on their datasheet unless specified.

* All units that have a Ranged only Invulnerable save will include a `#++ invuln save (ranged only)` unit ability that should always be enabled.

## Army Rule
* **`Harbringers of Dread:`** <br> To simulate `Doom and Darkness` add `+1 to wound roll` & `-1 to hit roll` to the **Global Modifiers**.
