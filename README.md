## General Information
Each directory contains the following:
* `.txt` Data Export (import file for UnitCrunch)
* `Changlog.md` record of changes
* `readme.md` Information about the upload file(s)

Once you have imported the Data Export the profile will need to be configured by yourself. This will generally just be changing the `Model count` and the weapons `Count per unit`, but some profiles will need more configuration this is usually documented in the `readme.md` of that faction.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute please read the `contributing.md`, here we outline the file structure and formatting that can streamline creating the `readme.md`.
There are also quick start templates in the `Templates` directory.

## Todo list
- [ ] Update `T'au data export`
  *  Legends units 
  *  Munitorum Field v1.3+
  *  Formatting to match the `contributing.md` guidelines.
- [ ] Update existing Data Exports with the `PSYCHIC` Keyword.
